# Fuel-Efficiency-Prediction
Here, we predict the efficiency of fuel. First Linear Regression is used, then DNN using single unit is used and then DNN using all units is implemented. There is a comparison done to check which model performs better. Check file above PredictFuelEfficiency.ipynb for complete code, implementation and outputs.
